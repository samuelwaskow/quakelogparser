# Game Log Parser

This project is a Java-based parser for a log file generated by the Quake 3 Arena server. The goal of the project is to extract data from the log file, process it, and store it in a database. The parser is then used to create a RESTful API that exposes this data to a front-end interface built with React JS.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java 8 or higher installed on your machine.
3. Ensure you have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine.
4. Open a command line terminal and navigate to the project "backend" directory.
5. Run `gradle bootJar` to build the project and download the dependencies.
6. Run `java -jar build/libs/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` to start the server.
7. Open another command line terminal and navigate to the "frontend" directory.
8. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
9. Run `npm start` to start the React app.

## Project

The project consists of two main components: the parser/RESTful API and the frontend.

### Parser

The parser is responsible for reading the log file, extracting data from it, and storing that data in a database.

The parser reads the log file line-by-line extracting the data. The data is then used to build objects representing game events, such as player deaths or kills. These objects are then stored in an H2 database using Spring Data JPA.

### RESTful API

The RESTful API is built using Spring Boot and exposes a single endpoint that returns a list of game events.

* GET /games

### Frontend

The frontend is a React JS application that consumes the data from the RESTful API. The frontend displays a list of game events, along with a ranking of kills per player.

## Documentation

The project is organized into packages, each of which contains a set of related classes. Here is an overview of the packages and classes:

* `com.parser.controller.GameController`

This class defines the RESTful API endpoint for the game events. The controller uses Spring MVC annotations to map requests to methods.

* `com.parser.model.Game`
* `com.parser.model.GameKill`

These classes define the data model for the game events. Each class represents a different type of event, such as a player death or a player kill.

* `com.parser.repository.GameRepository`

These classes define the Spring Data JPA repositories used to store and retrieve game events from the database.

* `com.parser.service.GameService`
* `com.parser.service.ParserService`

These classes define the services used to parse the log file, store the data in the database and access the data models.

* `com.parser.dto.GameDTO`

These classes define the data transfer objects available for the parser and the REST API

* `frontend/src/*`

These files define the React JS frontend for the project. The main components are:

- `App.js`: the main application component
- `GameList.js`: a component that displays a list of game events
- `PlayerRanking.js`: a component that displays a ranking of kills per player
